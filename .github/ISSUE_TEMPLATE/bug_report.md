**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Screenshots and savegames**
Savegames often helps a lot when reproducing issues as well as testing fixes, so provide one if a savegame can make it easier to reproduce the problem. Screenshots can be used as well if it helps explaining something on the screen, which isn't obvious with text.

**Personal modifications**
Did you change anything in the mod or game, like changing xml data or using world builder?

**Version of We The People**
Version of release or in case of development version, a date for when it was compiled will be fine. Note that this is included in savegames, so if one is provided, the precise development version will not be needed, just a rough estimate.

**Additional context**
